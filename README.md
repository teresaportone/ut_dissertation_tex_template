This is the .tex files I used for my UT thesis in 2019. It's (IMO) lighter weight and easier to customize than the tex files provided on the official UT site. 
Please be aware that I am NOT maintaining this to ensure it stays up to date with current UT formatting requirements, so check that it is still appropriate.
Congratulations on taking this exciting step towards completing your PhD!
